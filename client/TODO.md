- add admin panel component to client
  - create user
  - reset other people's password (with mailout of reset password)
  - add ability to lock account
- add avatar upload and display
- start using github issues to track things to do :)
- build full-text search in back end
- tidy up client layout
  - shrink header vertically
  - get footer to stay at bottom of screen
  - possibly rearrange header so that the logo sits to the left of everything else in the header
- add email notification of logbook posts
  - add email taget to groups
  - add manual email address addition to logbook entries (should who the entry was mailed to be stored?)
- make search box prettier (add reset x, and may a nice magnifying glass...)
